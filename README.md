## Overview

Provides useful callbacks once descendant images have loaded.

waitForImages also supports both images referenced in CSS, such as the `background-image` property, and images referenced in element attributes such as `srcset`. Images referenced in attributes can also be a comma-separated list of images.

It can be useful when WebKit incorrectly reports element dimensions/offsets on document ready, because it has not calculated their descendant `img` dimensions yet.

Supports all browsers you probably care about.

## Get it

You can either grab the source yourself...

- [Production (minified)](https://raw.github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages/master/dist/jquery.waitforimages.min.js)
- [Development (unminified)](https://raw.github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages/master/dist/jquery.waitforimages.js)

...or you can use a hosted version...

- [Hosted on CDNJS (minified)](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.waitforimages/1.5.0/jquery.waitforimages.min.js)

Alternatively, you can install with [`bower`](http://bower.io/)...

```bash
bower install waitForImages
```

...or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)...

```bash
npm install jquery.waitforimages
```

Of course, these need to be loaded after `jQuery` is made available. The current version should be supported by at least jQuery 1.8, or perhaps earlier. If you find incompatibility issues, please check out a previous tagged version.

## Usage

There are two ways to use waitForImages: with a standard callback system (previously the only API) or receiving a promise.

### Standard

Just provide a callback function and it will be called once all descendant images have loaded.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages(() => {
    // All descendant images have loaded, now slide up.
    $(this).slideUp();
});
```

You can also use the jQuery promise API.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages().done(() => {
    // All descendant images have loaded, now slide up.
    $(this).slideUp();
});
```

In the callbacks, `this` is a reference to the collection that `waitForImages()` was called on.

### Advanced

You can pass a second function as a callback that will be called for each image that is loaded, with some information passed as arguments.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages(() => {
    alert('All images have loaded.');
}, (loaded, count, success) => {
   alert(`${loaded} of ${count} images has ${success ? 'loaded' : 'failed to load'}.`);
   $(this).addClass('loaded');
});
```

Using the jQuery promises API, you can then use the `progress()` method to know when an individual image has been loaded.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages().progress((loaded, count, success) => {
   alert(`${loaded} of ${count} images has ${success ? 'loaded' : 'failed to load'}.`);
   $(this).addClass('loaded');
});
```

You can also set the third argument to `true` if you'd like the plugin to iterate over the collection and all descendent elements, checking for images referenced in the CSS (by default, it looks at the `background-image`, `list-style-image`, `border-image`, `border-corner-image` and `cursor` properties). If it finds any, they will be treated as a descendant image.

The callback will be called on the successful **and** unsuccessful loading of the image. Check the third argument to determine the success of the image load. It will be `true` if the image loaded successfully.

If you want to skip the first argument, pass `$.noop` or alternatively, pass an object literal to the plugin, instead of the arguments individually.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages({
    finished: () => {
        // ...
    },
    each: () => {
       // ...
    },
    waitForAll: true
});
```

To use this with the promise API, simply pass one argument, which is `waitForAll`.

```javascript
$('selector').waitForImages(true).done(() => {
    // ...
});
```

You may also set the CSS properties that possibly contain image references yourself. Just assign an array of properties to the plugin.

```javascript
$.waitForImages.hasImgProperties = ['backgroundImage'];
```

waitForImages also exposes two custom selectors, `img:has-src` and `img:uncached`, (both used in conjunction with the `img` selector), which allow you to select `img` elements with a valid `src` attribute or that are not already cached already by the browser, respectively.

```javascript
$('img').not(':has-src').remove();
$('img:uncached').attr('title', 'Loading Image');
```
